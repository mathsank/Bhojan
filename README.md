Bhojan

Bhojan is an Android App with a social cause: to feed the homeless, done in partnership with a good-will community club. The problem that we wish to solve is to find the places where the homeless are in most need of food, and for this, the app draws a crowd sourced user base. Users log in to the application to find a map layout. They then proceed to "tag" or mark on the map with markers a set of homeless people in need of food. The club members then go to these locations to feed the homeless.

Currently under development - watch this space for more to come!
